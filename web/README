cherrypy has a bug (at least in 3.2.2) when running with SSL. The large POSTs crash.
In order to solve this a workaround must be done in the file 

cherrypy/wsgiserver/wsgiserver2.py

The line 1052:     

assert n <= left, "recv(%d) returned %d bytes" % (left, n)

must be replaced by:

#assert n <= left, "recv(%d) returned %d bytes" % (left, n)
#workaround to fix SSL assertion error with large POST
elif n > left:
    # Could happen with SSL transport. Differ
    # extra data read to the next call
    buf.write(data[:left])
    self._rbuf.write(data[left:])
    del data
    break
